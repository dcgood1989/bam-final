## Rails Assessment One

### Getting Started

-  Fork and clone this repository.
-  Create your database and get started by running `rspec`

### Overview

The specs in this repository walk through implementing user authentication as well as CRUD for magazines. There are both feature and model specs, and the recommended order to complete these in are as follows:

-  User Model
-  User feature spec
-  Magazine Model
-  Magazine feature spec

You will know you are complete with this assessment when the entirety of the test suite (12 specs) is passing. This application is designed to root to the magazines index page, and gives both a user and guest the ability to CRUD magazines.
